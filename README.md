Calculator is a simple yet visually appealing web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS . It features a modern dark theme with vibrant 
button colors for a stylish user interface. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage. 
Designed to be responsive and easy to use, it works smoothly across devices and screen sizes. The user interface includes clearly defined buttons: a red "AC" button to 
clear the display, cyan-colored operator buttons, a bright purple equals button, and dark gray number buttons for a bold, clean look. This project is ideal for beginners 
looking to understand how to build interactive web applications with clean structure and responsive design. You can view the live interface by opening the `index.html` file
in your browser.
